## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Bootstrap 4

### What I learned

What I learned about bootstrap: I'm able to change the order of columns within a container based on endpoints by using 'order-<endpoint>-<target>' as a class.

### Continued development

I want to continue to develope my css skills, along with my bootstrap knowledge.. there's a lot to learn. In regard to this challenge, I still haven't figured out how to effectively make the image 100% responsive.

### Useful resources

-   [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) - This helped me to find end points for the media queries I would implement manually. It also helped me to make the images responsive.
